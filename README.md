## Changes to code:
  1. Header 'div' to 'header'.
  1. Navigation portion 'div' tags within the header of the page to 'nav'.
  1. Main body of the page from 'div' to 'section' and 'aside'.
  1. 'div' tags in the footer to 'footer'.
  
    * In the CSS code I updated the style coding that was linked to the div tags to match what was in the HTML element of 'nav' instead of 'div'
I also fixed the "Search Engine Optimization" to include a 'nav id' so that when the link is clicked on, it brings you to the proper part of the webpage.
I organized the header section so that they are in alphabetical order in the header and in the order in which they appear on the website.
